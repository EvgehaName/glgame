## Setup:

- Clone the repository (you should not download it as an archive)
   - If you are using Git console, here's the command:
    - `git clone (url) --recursive`
   - If you are using Git client:
    - You can just push `Open in Desktop` if you are using Github Desktop.
    - Then type this command in the Git console `git submodule update --init --recursive`
    - If this command fails for any reason, use `git submodule sync` and then retry the above command.
- Now you can build the engine!
